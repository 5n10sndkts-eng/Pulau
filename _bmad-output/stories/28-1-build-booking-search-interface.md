### Story 28.1: Build Booking Search Interface

As an **admin**,
I want to search bookings by various criteria,
So that I can find specific bookings for support.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am on the admin dashboard
**When** I use the booking search
**Then** I can search by:

- Booking ID (exact match)
- Traveler email (partial match)
- Vendor name (partial match)
- Date range
- Booking status
  **And** results show key booking details
  **And** I can click a booking to view full details
  **And** search supports pagination for large result sets
