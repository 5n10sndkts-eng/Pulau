### Story 12.6: Create Traveler Stories Section

As a traveler seeking social proof,
I want to read stories from other travelers,
So that I can learn from their experiences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am on the Explore screen
**When** "Stories from Travelers" section loads
**Then** I see vertical list of story cards
**And** stories sourced from reviews with photos and 200+ character text
**And** card displays: traveler photo, name, country, story excerpt, experience thumbnail
**And** cards expandable to show full story
**When** I tap "Read More" on a story
**Then** full review displays with all photos
**And** link to the experience being reviewed
