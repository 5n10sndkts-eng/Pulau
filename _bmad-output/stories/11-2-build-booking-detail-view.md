### Story 11.2: Build Booking Detail View

As a traveler,
I want to view complete details of a booking,
So that I can access all confirmation information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I tap a booking card from history
**When** the booking detail screen loads
**Then** I see read-only trip view identical to trip builder layout
**And** header shows: booking reference (copyable), status badge, booked date
**And** all trip items display with: date, time, experience details, guest count
**And** operator contact info visible for each experience
**And** meeting point info accessible
**And** price summary shows: what was paid, payment method last 4 digits
**And** "Need Help?" link to support
**And** screen is read-only (no editing capabilities)
