### Story 1.4: Configure Animation Library and Icon System

As a developer,
I want Framer Motion and Phosphor icons configured,
So that we can implement smooth animations and consistent iconography.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** component architecture is established from Story 1.3
**When** Framer Motion and Phosphor icons are installed
**Then** Framer Motion AnimatePresence wrapper is available for route transitions
**And** Phosphor icons library is imported with rounded style and 2px stroke
**And** Sonner toast library is configured for notifications
**And** sample animation (button click with scale) works smoothly at 60fps
**And** sample icons render (House, Compass, Heart, User)
**And** reduced-motion media query support is implemented
