### Story 25.4: Add Instant Confirmation Filter

As a **traveler**,
I want to filter experiences by "Instant Confirmation",
So that I can find experiences that confirm immediately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am browsing experiences
**When** I enable the "Instant Confirmation" filter
**Then** only experiences with `instant_book_enabled = true` are shown
**And** each result shows an "Instant" badge
**And** the filter is available on search results and category browse screens
