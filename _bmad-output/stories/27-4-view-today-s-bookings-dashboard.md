### Story 27.4: View Today's Bookings Dashboard

As a **vendor**,
I want to see all bookings for today,
So that I can prepare for my guests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am on my vendor operations page
**When** I view "Today's Bookings"
**Then** I see a list of all bookings for today's date:
  - Time slot
  - Traveler name
  - Guest count
  - Check-in status (Pending / Checked In / No Show)
**And** I can filter by experience (if I have multiple)
**And** I can mark no-shows after the experience time passes
**And** total guest count is summarized at top
