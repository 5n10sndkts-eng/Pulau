### Story 26.5: PWA Installation and Offline Indicator

As a **traveler**,
I want to install Pulau as a PWA,
So that I have app-like access to my tickets.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I visit Pulau on a mobile browser
**When** the PWA installation prompt appears
**Then** I can add Pulau to my home screen
**And** the PWA icon reflects Pulau branding
**And** when launched, shows splash screen
**And** when offline, shows "Offline" banner at top of app
**And** offline-capable pages remain functional
