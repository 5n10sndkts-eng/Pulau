### Story 14.2: Create Revenue Chart Visualization

As a vendor,
I want to see revenue trends over time,
So that I can identify patterns in my business.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am on the vendor analytics dashboard
**When** the revenue section loads
**Then** I see a line chart showing:

- X-axis: time periods (days/weeks/months based on range)
- Y-axis: revenue in vendor's currency
- Line with data points
- Hover/tap shows exact value for each point
  **And** chart uses primary teal color
  **And** "Total for Period" displayed above chart
  **And** chart renders smoothly with animation on load
