### Story 14.4: Implement Conversion Funnel View

As a vendor,
I want to see where travelers drop off,
So that I can improve my listings.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am viewing detailed analytics for an experience
**When** the funnel section loads
**Then** I see visual funnel showing:

- Impressions (shown in browse) → X travelers
- Page Views (detail page) → Y travelers
- Added to Trip → Z travelers
- Booked → N travelers
  **And** percentage drop-off shown between each stage
  **And** funnel colored with gradient (teal to coral)
  **And** suggestions displayed if conversion is below benchmark
